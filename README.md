# Battery Usage for macOS

This is a simple utility that is based on [this question][stack] on Stack Overflow and the associated [script][script]
in Github by [DudNr33](https://github.com/DudeNr33).  I started by fixing up the script, but wanted to change a lot
of the mechanics of the script to make it a bit easier to test and embed in other contexts (such as a menu bar app).
